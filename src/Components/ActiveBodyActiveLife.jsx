        "Exercise strengthens the heart, improves lung function, and boosts the immune system. It helps manage weight, lowers blood pressure, and reduces the risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Physical activity also improves flexibility, coordination, and muscle strength, which are essential for everyday movements and injury prevention.<br></br><br></br>
        Beyond the physical benefits, regular exercise has a powerful impact on mental health. It can reduce stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression by releasing endorphins — the body’s natural mood enhancers. People who stay active often report better sleep, higher self-esteem, and improved focus. Making fitness a consistent part of your daily routine promotes not only a longer life but also a more energetic, confident, and balanced lifestyle."
